# Chat Auto-Scroll Challenge

## Setup

1. Get a free Gemini API key from [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev)
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run` (web, macOS, or any platform)
4. Enter your API key and start chatting

## Your Task

This app has scroll UX issues. Compare it against the reference implementation and fix them.

**Reference:** https://iman-admin.github.io/chat-scroll-demo/

Test these scenarios in the reference demo before you start coding. Start by sending a message that produces a long response to fill the screen (e.g. _"Write a detailed essay about the history of the internet"_). If the response is too short, send another one.

1. Send a message and let the response stream in.
2. While a response is streaming, scroll up manually.
3. While scrolled up, send a new message.
4. While a response is streaming, scroll back down to the bottom.

Your solution will be scored primarily on how closely it matches the reference. You are free to use any AI tools you'd like.

## How to Submit

1. Clone this repo into a **private** repository on your own GitHub account.
2. Implement your solution.
3. Deploy your solution to the web.
4. Update this README with:
   - The UX issues you identified and fixed.
   - Your deployed URL.
   - Include screen recordings for all five scenarios and the deployed URL below.
5. Add **IMan-admin** as a collaborator to your private repo.
6. Send us the link to your repo.
